# dewpoint-measurementt-Arduino
- Temperature and humidity measurement using the SHT30 sensor: data can be displayed in the serial monitor.

- The dewpoint is calculated from temperature and humidity. The temperature, humidity and dewpoint can be displayed now on the serial monitor.

- In the program, a formula is used to calculate the dew point, which was derived from the Magnus formula, which comes from the Clausius Clapeyron equation. Here you can see the     derivations.

- The measured values are now displayed on the LCD display.
